# Automating the configuration of a 'fresh' Raspberry Pi
This will be used to build Raspberry Pi's with some level of automation - hopefully getting better over time.

## Usage
You just need to clone this repository, change directory in to the local clone and then run the bash script:
```
git clone https://github.com/richyrichking/pi-build.git
cd pi-build
./scripts/build.sh
```
